## Improved SHACL Implementation
RDF4J sports the worlds only SHACL implementation capable of analyzing your transactional changes to 
calculate the most efficient validation approach. For our users this means that 


## Faster Isomorphism Detection

The graph isomorphism algorithm (used to check if models are equivalent under a blank node mapping by 
the Models.isomorphic utility function) has been completely reimplemented. Where the previous naive 
depth-first search approach had very poor performance (sometimes not terminating at all even on 
relatively small models), the current implementation, based on an approach outlined by Aidan Hogan in 
his 2017 paper "Canonical Forms for Isomorphic and Equivalent RDF Graphs: Algorithms for Leaning and 
Labelling Blank Nodes" [PDF] has been shown to have very good performance characteristics for almost 
all practical cases, and is guaranteed to terminate in reasonable time.
